# Changelog

See the [release policy](RELEASE_POLICY.md) for versioning and migration rules.

## Unreleased

- Button's shape, size, type, elevation, state colors, and motion are CSS
  variables. Press and release take separate durations and easings, and the
  radius and `corner-shape` can change on press. `buttonTheme` maps typed settings
  to those variables. Button sets `data-slot`, `data-variant`, and `data-size`.
- `--ease-spring`, `--ease-snap`, and `--ease-settle` are new easing tokens.
- Migration: `--color-primary-hover` and `--color-primary-active` are removed.
  Hover and press colors are derived from `--color-primary`. Tune them with
  `--button-hover-layer` and `--button-press-layer`. `--color-disabled` and
  `--color-disabled-foreground` are removed. A disabled button fades to
  `--button-disabled-opacity`. `--radius-control` is now `0.75rem`.
- Default Button: a vivid OKLCH indigo palette. Filled variants have a
  hue-shifted gradient, a colored glow, a faint sheen, and a 1px edge. Hover lifts
  the button, turns the gradient, and brightens the glow. Corners are squircles
  that tighten on press, with a 120ms snap press and a 450ms spring release.
  Reduced motion keeps color changes and drops scale and movement.
- Button adds `variant` (primary, secondary, warning, destructive, outline,
  ghost), `size` (small, default, large), `radius` (none, small, default, large,
  full), `iconOnly`, and `fullWidth`. New color tokens back each variant.
- `class-variance-authority` 0.7.1 is a new runtime dependency.
- `pending` keeps the label's space, shows a spinner, and ignores activation.
  It does not set `disabled`, so focus can stay on the button.
- Keyboard, focus, and screen reader checks were not run in this change.
  Storybook has no interaction runner yet, and Button is not marked ready.

## 0.0.2

- Documentation and maintainer tooling cleanup. The Button API, styles and
  dependency requirements are unchanged; no migration is needed.
- Still experimental, with a single native Button. Automated package checks do
  not replace manual keyboard, focus and screen reader verification.

## 0.0.1

- Public package identity for the first, `0.0.1` release. Do not expect granular updates until package is mature enough to be used by third parties.
